# WebGL 1.0

Hereâ€™s a fundamental summary of each concept:

- **Buffers**: Arrays of binary data uploaded to the GPU for various attributes like positions and colors.
- **Attributes**: Specify how to extract data from buffers and provide it to the vertex shader.
- **Uniforms**: Global variables set before shader execution, used to pass consistent data to shaders.
- **Textures**: Data arrays used in shaders for random access, often for image data but can be any type of data.
- **Varyings**: Data passed from the vertex shader to the fragment shader, interpolated depending on the rendered primitives (points, lines, triangles).
